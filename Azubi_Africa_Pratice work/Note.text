<body> tagThe <body> tag in HTML is an essential element used to` enclose and define all the visible content that appears on a  webpage. It serves as the container for the content that users see and interact with when they access the webpage through a web browser.When a user visits a website, the web browser reads and interprets the HTML code of the webpage. The `<body>` tag's content is what the browser displays as the actual web page that users can read, view, and interact with. This includes all the text, images, videos, links, forms, and other elements that make up the visual and interactive components of the webpage.Everything you want to present to your users, from simple paragraphs and headings to complex multimedia content, must be placed within the `<body>` element.

and styled using HTML and CSS to achieve the desired visual appearance and layout.It's crucial to understand that the `<body>` tag works in conjunction with the `<head>` section of the HTML document.

HTML AttributesHTML attributes are special properties that provide additional information about HTML elements. They are used to modify the behavior or appearance of an element and can be applied to all HTML elements. Attributes are always specified in the start tag of an element and are enclosed in double quotes ("") or single quotes(‘’), following the format of name/value pairs.Consider the following HTML `<a>` (anchor) element, which creates a hyperlink: <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>In this example:-`href` is the attribute name, which stands for "hypertextreference."-`"https://www.example.com"` is the attribute value, whichis the URL the anchor element links to.
Universal UsageAll HTML elements can have attributes, but not all elements require them. Some elements, like `<img>`, must have certain attributes tofunction correctly. For instance, the `<img>` element requires the `src` attribute to specify the image file location.Location in Start TagAttributes are always specified within the opening (start) tag of an element. They provide information about the element's behavior, appearance, or other characteristics.Name/Value PairsAttributes generally follow a name/value pair structure, separated by an equal sign (`=`). The name represents the attribute's purpose, and the value defines its specific content or behavior. The entire attribute is enclosed in double quotes
Multiple AttributesAn HTML element can have multiple attributes, each separated by a space. For example: <a href=https://www.example.comtarget="_blank“ class="external-link">Visit Example</a>In this case, the anchor (`<a>`) element has three attributes:`href`, `target`, and `class`.Global and Specific AttributesSome attributes are considered global and can be applied to any element (e.g., `class`, `id`, `style`). Others are specific to certain elements (e.g., `src` for images, `href` for hyperlinks).Boolean AttributesSome attributes don't require a value; their presence alone signifies a specific state. These are called booleanattributes. For example, the `disabled` attribute in a form element is used without a value to disable user interaction. <input type="text" name="username" disabled>
